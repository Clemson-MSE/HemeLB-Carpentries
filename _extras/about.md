The content of this lesson has been undertaken as part of FocusCOE, in promoting the use of HPC for HPC-oriented
libraries. 

The team is thankful for the initial groundwork made by the developers of the 
[Running LAMMPS on HPC systems](https://fzj-jsc.github.io/tuning_lammps/index.html) Carpentries course, from which 
episodes 01 and 02 of this course are based.
